# Leveraging Organic Biomass for Advanced Cosmetic Formulations

**Created by: Deepak J**

This project aims to revolutionize waste management in salons by converting discarded human hair into valuable ingredients—specifically melanin and keratin—for sustainable skincare and haircare products like sunscreens. Built as an e-commerce platform using Java and MySQL, the project enables both backend processing and product showcasing with environmental impact in focus.

## 🌱 Project Abstract

The project streamlines client-salon interactions while reducing environmental pollution by reusing human hair waste. Hair contains **melanin** and **keratin**, which are used in UV-blocking sunscreens and protein-rich haircare products. Our system enhances the extraction process and utilizes **Decision Tree algorithms** to determine optimal hair processing conditions.

## 💡 Key Features

- Eco-friendly product formulation using human hair waste.
- Java-based e-commerce platform.
- Keratin and melanin extraction automation.
- Integration with salons for hair waste collection.
- Uses machine learning (Decision Tree) for optimization.
- Educational awareness about sustainable beauty.

---

## 🌍 Scope of the Project

- Build partnerships with salons for hair waste collection.
- Pre-process hair to eliminate contaminants.
- Apply temperature-controlled processes for optimal extraction.
- Develop biodegradable, non-toxic skincare and haircare products.
- Scale up with distribution and educational outreach.

## 🔎 Existing System Limitations

- Reliance on non-human sources (mushrooms, squid ink, etc.) for melanin.
- Environmental imbalance from overharvesting natural sources.
- Limited frameworks for salon waste recycling.

---

## 🚀 Proposed Enhancements

- Direct hair-to-cosmetic transformation pipeline.
- Reduce CO₂ emissions and landfill load.
- Introduce workshops and awareness campaigns.
- Use **Life Cycle Assessments (LCA)** for impact measurement.
